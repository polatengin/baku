# Baku Project

This repo includes a project for peer-to-peer video chat with WebRTC.

The reason I made this project;

* To learn how to inject javascript and css into an html page by configuring Webpack and PostCSS

* Experience and understand how browsers are processing keyboard events

* Create and run a pipeline with GitHub Actions

* Gain the habit of project development within Visual Studio Code DevContainer

Technologies I used in this project are;

* Typescript
* WebPack
* PostCSS
* GitHub Actions
* Docker
* Netlify
* DevContainers

## WebRTC

With WebRTC, you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard.

It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions.

The technology is available on all modern browsers as well as on native clients for all major platforms.

The technologies behind WebRTC are implemented as an open web standard and available as regular JavaScript APIs in all major browsers.
