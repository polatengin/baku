# Baku Project

This repo includes a project for peer-to-peer video chat with WebRTC.

The reason I made this project;

* To learn how to inject javascript and css into an html page by configuring Webpack and PostCSS

* Experience and understand how browsers are processing keyboard events

* Create and run a pipeline with GitHub Actions

* Gain the habit of project development within Visual Studio Code DevContainer
